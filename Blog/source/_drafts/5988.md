            A coding contest will be held in this university, in a huge playground. The whole playground would be divided into N blocks, and there would be M directed paths linking these blocks. The i-th path goes from the ui-th block to the vi-th block. Your task is to solve the lunch issue. According to the arrangement, there are si competitors in the i-th block. Limited to the size of table, bi bags of lunch including breads, sausages and milk would be put in the i-th block. As a result, some competitors need to move to another block to access lunch. However, the playground is temporary, as a result there would be so many wires on the path.  
For the i-th path, the wires have been stabilized at first and the first competitor who walker through it would not break the wires. Since then, however, when a person go through the i - th path, there is a chance of pi to touch  
the wires and affect the whole networks. Moreover, to protect these wires, no more than ci competitors are allowed to walk through the i-th path.  
Now you need to find a way for all competitors to get their lunch, and minimize the possibility of network crashing.

{% endraw %}
              
The first line of input contains an integer t which is the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.  
For each test case, the first line consists of two integers N (N ≤ 100) and M (M ≤ 5000). Each of the next N lines contains two integers si and bi (si , bi ≤ 200).  
Each of the next M lines contains three integers ui , vi and ci(ci ≤ 100) and a float-point number pi(0 < pi < 1).  
It is guaranteed that there is at least one way to let every competitor has lunch.

For each turn of each case, output the minimum possibility that the networks would break down. Round it to 2 digits.

# 题解
这道题的题意比较绕  
大概就是对于一个有N个节点M条边的有向图  
每个节点有 <code>s<sub>i</sub></code> 个参赛选手 <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>个食物   
每个边最多能经过 <code>c<sub>i</sub></code> 个选手 有 <code>p<sub>i</sub></code> 的几率导致线路断开  
选手需要通过路径去获取食物,每条路第一次有人经过不会有影响,但之后每次有人经过都有 <code>p<sub>i</sub></code> 的概率导致线路故障  
求线路故障最小的概率  


可以看出是一道 **概率+网络流**  

求得最小的故障概率,也即最大的不故障概率  
因此可以用最大流问题求解  

概率的计算需要使用乘法,因此应该使用 `log` 将其化为加法   

以上为大概思路  

显然,对于每个节点的人,直接取用该节点的面包是最优的情况
