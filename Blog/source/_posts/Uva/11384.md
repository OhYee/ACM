# 题目
>> Dexter is tired of Dee Dee. So he decided to keep Dee Dee busy in a game.  
>> The game he planned for her is quite easy to play but not easy to win at least not for Dee Dee.  
>> But Dexter does not have time to spend on this silly task, so he wants your help.  
>>  
>> There will be a button, when it will be pushed a random number N will be chosen by computer.  
>>  
>> Then on screen there will be numbers from 1 to N.  
>> Dee Dee can choose any number of numbers from the numbers on the screen, and then she will command computer to subtract a positive number chosen by her (not necessarily on screen) from the selected numbers.  
>> Her objective will be to make all the numbers 0.  
>>  
>> For example if N = 3, then on screen there will be 3 numbers on screen: 1, 2, 3.  
>> Say she now selects 1 and 2.  
>> Commands to subtract 1, then the numbers on the screen will be: 0, 1, 3.  
>> Then she selects 1 and 3 and commands to subtract 1.  
>> Now the numbers are 0, 0, 2.  
>> Now she subtracts 2 from 2 and all the numbers become 0.  
>>  
>> Dexter is not so dumb to understand that this can be done very easily, so to make a twist he will give a limit L for each N and surely L will be as minimum as possible so that it is still possible to win within L moves.  
>> But Dexter does not have time to think how to determine L for each N, so he asks you to write a code which will take N as <!--more-->  
>> 
>>  Input and give L as Output.  
>  
> ## Input  
>> Input consists of several lines each with N such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 1, 000, 000, 000.  
>> Input will be terminated by end of file.  
>  
> ## Output  
>> For each N output L in separate lines.  
>>  
> 
> ## Sample Input  
>> 1  
>> 2  
>> 3  
> 
> ## Sample Output  
>> 1  
>> 2  
>> 2  


# 题解
对 `1~n` 的数,可以任意选一些数,使这些数同时减去一个整数,最后使所有数都为 `0`  
求最少的步骤数   

采用二分的思路解题,每次将最大的一部分折半减小,这样两部分就相等了,可以看作一部分  
每次都可以减少一半的工作量  

二分法的思路,类似二分法的时间复杂度  
最后的结果就是 <code>log<sub>2</sub>n</code> 答案向上取整  
注意浮点数到整数的浮点误差
