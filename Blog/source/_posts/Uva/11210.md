# 题目
>> Mahjong ( ) is a game of Chinese origin usually played by four persons with tiles resembling dominoes  
>> and bearing various designs, which are drawn and discarded until one player wins with a hand of four  
>> combinations of three tiles each and a pair of matching tiles.  
>> A set of Mahjong tiles will usually differ from place to place. It usually has at least 136 tiles, most  
>> commonly 144, although sets originating from America or Japan will have more. The 136-tile Mahjong  
>> includes:  
>> Dots: named as each tile consists of a number of circles. Each circle is said to represent copper  
>> (tong) coins with a square hole in the middle. In this problem, they’re represented by 1T, 2T, 3T, 4T,  
>> 5T, 6T, 7T, 8T and 9T.  
>> Bams: named as each tile (except the 1 Bamboo) consists of a number of bamboo sticks. Each  
>> stick is said to represent a string (suo) that holds a hundred coins. In this problem, they’re represented  
>> by 1S, 2S, 3S, 4S, 5S, 6S, 7S, 8S and 9S.  
>> Craks: named as each tile represents ten thousand (wan) coins, or one hundred strings of one  
>> hundred coins. In this problem, they’re represented by 1W, 2W, 3W, 4W, 5W, 6W, 7W, 8W and 9W.  
>> Wind tiles: East, South, West, and North. In this problem, they’re represented by DONG, NAN,  
>> XI, BEI.  
>> Dragon tiles: red, green, and white. The term dragon tile is a western convention introduced by  
>> Joseph Park Babcock in his 1920 book introducing Mahjong to America. Originally, these tiles are  
>> said to have something to do with the Chinese Imperial Examination. The red tile means you pass the  
>> examination and thus will be appointed a government official. The green tile means, consequently you  
>> will become financially well off. The white tile (a clean board) means since you are now doing well you  
>> should act like a good, incorrupt official. In this problem, they’re represented by ZHONG, FA, BAI.  
>> There are 9   3 + 4 + 3 = 34 kinds, with exactly 4 tiles of each kind, so there are 136 tiles in total.  
>> To who may be interested, the 144-tile Mahjong also includes:  
>> Flower tiles: typically optional components to a set of mahjong tiles, often contain artwork on  
>> their tiles. There are exactly one tile of each kind, so 136+8=144 tiles in total. In this problem, we  
>> don t consider these tiles.  
>> Chinese Mahjong is very complicated. However, we only need to know very few of the rules in order  
>> to solve this problem. A meld is a certain set of tiles in one’s hand. There are three kinds of melds  
>> you need to know (to who knows Mahjong already, kong is not considered):  
>> Pong: A set of three identical titles. Example: , .  
>> Chow: A set of three suited tiles in sequence. All three tiles must be of the same suites. Sequences  
>> of higher length are not permissible (unless it forms more than one meld). Obviously, wind tiles and  
>> dragon tiles can never be involved in chows. Example: , .  
>> Eye: The pair, while not a meld, is the final component to the standard hand. It consists of any  
>> two identical tiles.  
>> A player wins the round by creating a standard mahjong hand. That means, the hand consists of  
>> an eye and several (possible zero) pongs and chows. Note that each title can be involved in exactly one  
>> eye/pong/chow.  
>> When a hand is one tile short of wining, the hand is said to be a ready hand, or more figuratively,  
>> ’on the pot’. The player holding a ready hand is said to be waiting for certain tiles. For example  
>> is waiting for , and .  
>> To who knows more about Mahjong: don’t consider special winning hands such as ‘ ’.  
>> <!--more-->  
> 
> ## Input  
>> The input consists of at most 50 test cases. Each case consists of 13 tiles in a single line. The hand is  
>> legal (e.g. no invalid tiles, exactly 13 tiles). The last case is followed by a single zero, which should not  
>> be processed.  
> 
> ## Output  
>> For each test case, print the case number and a list of waiting tiles sorted in the order appeared in  
>> the problem ## Description (1T 9T, 1S 9S, 1W 9W, DONG, NAN, XI, BEI, ZHONG, FA, BAI). Each waiting tile  
>> should be appeared exactly once. If the hand is not ready, print a message ‘Not ready’ without quotes.  
> 
> ## Sample Input  
>> 1S 1S 2S 2S 2S 3S 3S 3S 7S 8S 9S FA FA  
>> 1S 2S 3S 4S 5S 6S 7S 8S 9S 1T 3T 5T 7T  
>> 0  
> 
> ## Sample Output  
>> Case 1: 1S 4S FA  
>> Case 2: Not ready  


# 题解
给出手中已有的牌,求再加哪些牌能 **“和”**  

总共只有 `23` 张排,枚举即可  
先枚举所有的可能  
再枚举所有的 **“将”**(两张一样的)  
再对剩下的牌分别用不同的方式凑成 **“顺”** 和 **“刻”**  

纯 **暴力模拟**   
时刻明确自己在干什么,函数分清楚就行
