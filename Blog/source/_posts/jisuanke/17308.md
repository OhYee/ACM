<div class="oj"><div class="part" title="Description">
Consider a system which is described at any time as being in one of a set of $N$ distinct states, $1,2,3,...,N$. We denote the time instants associated with state changes as $t = 1,2,...$, and the actual state at time $t$ as $a\_{ij} = p = [s\_{i}=j\ |\ s\_{i-1}=i], 1\le i,j \le N$.

For the special case of a discrete, first order, Markovchain, the probabilistic description for the current state (at time $t$) and the predecessor state is $s\_{t}$. Furthermore we only consider those processes being independent of time, thereby leading to the set of state transition probability $a\_{ij}$ of the form: with the properties $a\_{ij} \geq 0$ and $\sum\_{i=1}^{N} A\_{ij} = 1 $. 

The stochastic process can be called an observable Markovmodel. Now, let us consider the problem of a simple 4-state Markov model of weather. We assume that once a day (e.g., at noon), the weather is observed as being one of the following:
- State $1$: snow
- State $2$: rain
- State $3$: cloudy
- State $4$: sunny

The matrix $A$ of state transition probabilities is:


$A = \{a\_{ij}\}= \begin{Bmatrix} a\_{11}& a\_{12}& a\_{13}&a\_{14} \\\\
a\_{21}&a\_{22}&a\_{23}&a\_{24} \\\\
a\_{31}&a\_{32}&a\_{33}&a\_{34} \\\\
a\_{41}&a\_{42}&a\_{43}&a\_{44} 
\end{Bmatrix}$


Given the model, several interestingquestions about weather patterns over time can be asked (and answered). We canask the question: what is the probability (according to the given model) thatthe weather for the next $k$ days willbe? Another interesting question we can ask: given that the model is in a knownstate, what is the expected number of consecutive days to stay in that state?Let us define the observation sequence $O$ as $O = \left \\{ s\_{1}, s\_{2}, s\_{3}, ... , s\_{k} \right \\}$, and the probability of the observation sequence $O$ given the model is defined as $p(O|model)$. 

Also, let the expected number of consecutive days to stayin state $i$ be $E\_{i}$. Assume that the initial state probabilities $p[s\_{1} = i] = 1, 1 \leq i \leq N$. Both $p(O|model)$ and $E\_{i}$ are real numbers.

</div><div class="part" title="Input">
Line $1$~$4$ for the state transition probabilities. Line $5$ for the observation sequence $O\_{1}$, and line $6$ for the observation sequence $O\_{2}$. Line $7$ and line $8$ for the states of interest to find the expected number of consecutive days to stay in these states.

Line $1$: $a\_{11}\ a\_{12}\ a\_{13}\ a\_{14}$
Line $2$: $a\_{21}\ a\_{22}\ a\_{23}\ a\_{34}$

Line $6$: $s\_{1}\ s\_{2}\ s\_{3}\ ...\ s\_{l}$
Line $7$: $i$
Line $8$: $j$

</div><div class="part" title="Output">
Line $1$ and line $2$ are used to show the probabilities of the observation sequences $O\_{1}$ and $O\_{2}$ respectively. 
Line $3$ and line $4$ are for the expected number of consecutive days to stay in states $i$ and $j$ respectively.

Line $2$: $p[O\_{2} | model]$
Line $3$: $E\_{i}$
Line $4$: $E\_{j}$
Please be reminded that the floating number should accurate to $10^{-8}$.

# 题解
> 给你一个状态转移的概率矩阵，有四组询问，前两组询问按照序列顺序出现的概率；后两种询问指定状态连续出现的期望天数

显然前者就是按照顺序求一下概率的乘积  
后者可以很容易推出是等比数列求和  

难点在于输入和读题
