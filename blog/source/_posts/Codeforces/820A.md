<div class="oj"><div class="part" title="Description">
Mister B once received a gift: it was a book about aliens, which he started read immediately. This book had c pages.

At first day Mister B read v0 pages, but after that he started to speed up. Every day, starting from the second, he read a pages more than on the previous day (at first day he read v0 pages, at second — v0?+?a pages, at third — v0?+?2a pages, and so on). But Mister B is just a human, so he physically wasn't able to read more than v1 pages per day.

Also, to refresh his memory, every day, starting from the second, Mister B had to reread last l pages he read on the previous day. Mister B finished the book when he read the last page for the first time.

Help Mister B to calculate how many days he needed to finish the book.

</div><div class="part" title="Input">
First and only line contains five space-separated integers: c, v0, v1, a and l (1?≤?c?≤?1000, 0?≤?l?<?v0?≤?v1?≤?1000, 0?≤?a?≤?1000) — the length of the book in pages, the initial reading speed, the maximum reading speed, the acceleration in reading speed and the number of pages for rereading.

</div><div class="part" title="Output">
Print one integer — the number of days Mister B needed to finish the book.

# 题解

> **题意**
> 一本有 `c` 页的书,第一天读 `v0` 页,每天比前一天多读 `a` 页(最多不超过 `v1`)  
> 同时每天需要复习前一天读过的 `l` 页  
> 问需要几天读完需要多久  


需要注意的是第一天是不需要复习前一天的内容的
